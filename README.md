# In the first age, in the first battle
# When the shadows first lengthened, one stood
# He chose the path of perpetual torment
# In his ravenous hatred he found no peace
# And with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains
# Seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him
# And those that tasted the bite of his sword named him
# The Doom Slayer
